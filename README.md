# BlackBox-BMS
The BlackBox-BMS project proposes the development of an embedded real-time battery management system specifically designed for scaled lithium-ion electric vehicle battery packs. This comprehensive system addresses critical gaps in academic BMS implementations by integrating advanced fault detection capabilities using finite state machine (FSM) architecture, continuous wireless telemetry, and comprehensive data logging. The primary objectives include implementing multi-sensor integration for voltage, current, and temperature monitoring, developing robust fault detection algorithms with automatic safety responses, establishing wireless communication for remote monitoring, and creating a scalable embedded solution suitable for low-voltage Li-ion applications. The project significance lies in enhancing battery safety through proactive fault management, enabling real-time performance optimization, and providing comprehensive telemetry data for predictive maintenance and system diagnostics.
